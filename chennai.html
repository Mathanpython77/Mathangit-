        Plot
        At the Visakhapatnam harbour, smuggler Simon Xavier runs an operation trafficking gold and luxury watches with
        his lieutenant Dayalan "Dayal." Simon's son, Arjun, rejects his family's criminal business and becomes a customs
        officer. An undercover cop posing as a coolie is killed by Dayal, who then offers a ₹2 crore reward for exposing
        another undercover officer in the gang.

        In Chennai, Devaraj "Deva" runs a strict boarding house. After learning of his friend Rajasekhar's death, he
        attends the funeral but is driven away by Rajasekhar's daughter, Preethi. A drunken friend, Ravi, admits he and
        Rajasekhar ruined their lives, prompting Deva to investigate. Though the autopsy claims a heart attack, Deva
        finds evidence of chest trauma. Rajasekhar, once broke, had invented an electric chair for disposing of animal
        remains. His patent rejected, he was coerced by Simon into adapting it for human use to dispose of murder
        victims. Dayal tries to abduct Preethi as she knew how to operate the electric chair after her father, but Deva
        intervenes and joins the operation, using the chair with her help. Deva tells Preethi to quit this profession,
        but Preethi is helpless as she wants to support her sisters.

        Eventually, Simon asks Deva to bury Dayal, claiming he was an undercover cop. They discover Dayal alive; he
        reveals his identity and threatens Preethi. Simon shows Deva a video of Dayal killing Rajasekhar. Dayal later
        contacts Deva from Nellore, demanding obedience and holding Preethi hostage in his hideout. Deva, following
        Dayal's orders, gains access to a harbour vault and uncovers a heart-trafficking ring targeting coolies. One
        order is to kill Arjun, but Deva spares him and asks him to run away with his lover in a boat. Dayal retaliates
        by threatening Preethi on a rooftop, but Deva unsettles him by revealing his real name, Dilip, and police past,
        working as a Constable in Thrissur.

        He then captures Dayal's wife, Kalyani, who was revealed to be duping lover of Arjun, and demands Preethi’s
        release. Kalyani frees herself, kills Ravi, and reveals that she and Dayal were undercover partners. She orders
        Dayal to pursue Preethi, who escapes on a train but unwittingly calls Deva using a code from Rajasekhar,
        revealing she is Deva’s daughter. Deva's aide sacrifices himself to protect her from Dayal, who survives.
        Kalyani tells Dayal to go to her car, which was parked. Dayal finds Arjun there. Dayal calls up Simon and
        reveals that he was alive, and kills Arjun in front of him. Simon goes to Chennai and sends his men to Deva's
        mansion to kill off Deva and Preethi's sisters, but Deva kills off his men with the help of his lieutenant,
        Kaleesha, and 18 coolies who worked with Deva. On reaching Chennai, Kalyani captures Preethi but is herself
        kidnapped by Simon's men. Simon kills Kalyani in front of Dayal, then seizes Preethi to harvest her heart.</p>
